## DPD Patrol Resource Management

Practicum project for Wayne State University (Summer 2025) supporting the Detroit Police Department (DPD). We analyzed non‑Priority 1 call patterns, unit deployment, and response times to help command staff rebalance workload without new spending.

## Data & Privacy

Underlying CAD Patrol, Out‑of‑Service, and other unit history datasets are not included because they contain information considered sensitive by the Detroit Police Department. Only aggregated results appear in the documents.

## Approach

- Built and iterated 17 Tableau dashboards, then consolidated into two main interactive dashboards.

- Created calculated fields and custom metrics (e.g., delay % over a 15‑minute threshold, Beat Balance Index).

- Compared precinct performance, focusing on Precincts 3 and 8 to understand why similar workloads produced very different delays.

## Key Findings (high level)

- Precincts 3 and 8 handled comparable call volumes; Precinct 3 achieved far lower delays due to broader platoon coverage and more daily units.

- Precinct 8 had the city’s highest delay rates and relied on a single platoon.

- Assist traffic was heavily one‑directional: Precinct 3 received extensive support citywide, about ~19k assists from each precinct in April 2025.

- A handful of vehicles showed disproportionate maintenance vs. fuel costs, suggesting candidates for repair or replacement.
